# Privacy Policy

Your privacy is important to us. It is Makeshift Software Inc's policy to respect your privacy and comply with any applicable law and regulation regarding any personal information we may collect about you, including via our app, Senpai, and its associated services.

Personal information is any information about you which can be used to identify you. This includes information about you as a person (such as name, address, and date of birth), your devices, payment details, and even information about how you use an app or online service.

In the event our app contains links to third-party sites and services, please be aware that those sites and services have their own privacy policies. After following a link to any third-party content, you should read their posted privacy policy information about how they collect and use personal information. This Privacy Policy does not apply to any of your activities after you leave our app.

This policy is effective as of 19 August 2023. Last updated: 19 August 2023.

## Information We Collect

Information we collect falls into one of two categories: “voluntarily provided” information and “automatically collected” information.

“Voluntarily provided” information refers to any information you knowingly and actively provide us when using our app and its associated services.

“Automatically collected” information refers to any information automatically sent by your device in the course of accessing our app and its associated services.

## Log Data

When you access our servers via our app, we may automatically log the standard data provided by your device. It may include your device's Internet Protocol (IP) address, your device type and version, your activity within the app, time and date, and other details about your usage.

Additionally, when you encounter certain errors while using the app, we automatically collect data about the error and the circumstances surrounding its occurrence. This data may include technical details about your device, what you were trying to do when the error happened, and other technical information relating to the problem. You may or may not receive notice of such errors, even in the moment they occur, that they have occurred, or what the nature of the error is.

Please be aware that while this information may not be personally identifying by itself, it may be possible to combine it with other data to personally identify individual persons.

## Device Data

Our app may access and collect data via your device's in-built tools, such as:

- Your identity
- Location data
- Camera
- Microphone
- Storage, photos and/or media

When you install the app or use your device’s tools within the app, we request permission to access this information. The specific data we collect can depend on the individual settings of your device and the permissions you grant when you install and use the app.

## Personal Information

We may ask for personal information — for example, when you submit content to us or when you contact us — which may include one or more of the following:

- Name
- Email
- Social media profiles
- Date of birth
- Phone/mobile number

Additionally, by using the Senpai app, you grant Makeshift Software Inc permission to collect and process your geographical location. We use this data to provide more accurate matches based on your proximity to other users.

## Demographic and Usage Data

We collect demographic information you provide, including age, gender, and other personal details. Additionally, we monitor the time you spend on our app to improve our services and enhance user experience. Your demographic data helps in ensuring we suggest the best possible matches.

## Anime Preferences

Your anime preferences, including your top 10 favorite anime (15 for premium users), are crucial in our match-making algorithm. By sharing these details, you help us curate better matches based on mutual interests.

## Spotify Syncing

Users have the option to sync their Spotify accounts. When synced, we display your top 5 artists and listened-to songs on your profile. This data is publicly accessible to others using the Senpai app.

## Sensitive Information

“Sensitive information” or “special categories of data” is a subset of personal information that is given a higher level of protection.

The types of sensitive information that we may collect about you include:

- Racial or ethnic origin
- Sexual orientation

We will not collect sensitive information about you without first obtaining your consent, and we will only use or disclose your sensitive information as permitted, required, or authorized by law.

## User-Generated Content

We consider “user-generated content” to be materials (text, image and/or video content) voluntarily supplied to us by our users for the purpose of publication on our platform, website or re-publishing on our social media channels. All user-generated content is associated with the account or email address used to submit the materials.

Please be aware that any content you submit for the purpose of publication will be public after posting (and subsequent review or vetting process). Once published, it may be accessible to third parties not covered under this privacy policy.

## Legitimate Reasons for Processing Your Personal Information

We only collect and use your personal information when we have a legitimate reason for doing so. In which instance, we only collect personal information that is reasonably necessary to provide our services to you.

## Security of Your Personal Information

When we collect and process personal information, and while we retain this information, we will protect it within commercially acceptable means to prevent loss and theft, as well as unauthorized access, disclosure, copying, use, or modification.

Although we will do our best to protect the personal information you provide to us, we advise that no method of electronic transmission or storage is 100% secure, and no one can guarantee absolute data security.

You are responsible for selecting any password and its overall security strength, ensuring the security of your own information within the bounds of our services. For example, ensuring any passwords associated with accessing your personal information and accounts are secure and confidential.

## How Long We Keep Your Personal Information

We keep your personal information only for as long as we need to. This time period may depend on what we are using your information for, in accordance with this privacy policy. For example, if you have provided us with personal information as part of creating an account with us, we may retain this information for the duration your account exists on our system. If your personal information is no longer required for this purpose, we will delete it or make it anonymous by removing all details that identify you.

However, if necessary, we may retain your personal information for our compliance with a legal, accounting, or reporting obligation or for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific, or historical research purposes or statistical purposes.

## Children’s Privacy

We do not aim any of our products or services directly at children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information about children under 13.
